  adviceText: "Why are my omelette not fluffy? Here are some reasons your omelette might not be fluffy. Eggs aren't fully beaten. You need to whip the eggs until the mixture is completely homogenous (uniform throughout). A dirty bowl. If you whip your eggs in an oily, dirty bowl, it will cause them to not be fluffy when cooked. A pan that's too large. If you use a pan that is larger than 8″ your omelette will be too thin and not fluffy.",

  adviceText: "Unless you're making a soufflé omelet, you're not whipping eggs to stiff peaks for your breakfast meal. It can be tempting to take things to the opposite extreme and just barely beat the eggs before adding them to the pan. While it might not seem like a big deal, your omelets will come out better if you thoroughly whip the eggs.",

  title: "Helpful advice!",
  adviceText: "For a firm white and runny yolk you'll want to poach the eggs for 3-4 minutes. I prefer a 3 minute poached egg. And if you plan to poach a batch of eggs ahead of time and reheat later, just keep in mind that reheating may firm up the eggs a little more as well.",

  description: "Poached eggs on rye buns",
  title: "Helpful advice!",
  adviceText: "The joy of a poached egg is its perfectly runny yolk and just-set whites. The yolk spills forth in a rich cascade, saucing your noodles, enriching your ramen broth, or adding depth to plain toast. Overcooking ruins this — no one likes to cut into a poached egg to find a pale yellow, immovable center.",

  title: "Helpful advice!",

  adviceText: "Salmon goes well with many herbs and spices: parsley, dill, basil, tarragon, sage, rosemary, bay leaves, thyme, fennel, oregano, chilli powder, and cumin... the list is endless. Season salmon before cooking. Seasoning will enhance the flavour of the fish, help the flesh stay firm, and preserve the vibrant pink colour of the salmon.",

  description: "Pancakes with honey and blackberries",
  title: "Helpful advice!",
  adviceText: "Always whisk the liquid ingredients together first, until you see bubbles begin to form. Then add the dry ingredients. This does a few important things: It emulsifies the fat and water in the batter, and it reduces over-mixing. Adding the dry ingredients on top of the wet also prevents the common issue of dry ingredients sticking to the bottom of the bowl.",

  description: "Pasta with champignons",
  title: "Helpful advice!",
  adviceText: "Pasta releases a lot of starch when cooking, so it's important to use a large pot of water. If you were to cook pasta in a small pot of water, the starches would make the water thick and your pasta slimy. To prevent this, just use four quarts of water (aka a gallon) for every pound of pasta you use.",

  description: "Pasta with champignons",
  title: "Helpful advice!",
  adviceText: "The best way to tell if pasta is done? By simply tasting it. Packaging directions can give you an idea of how long to cook your pasta, but it isn't foolproof. Not all boiling water is the same — lazily boiling water is different than water that's at a rolling boil, and they cook pasta at different speeds. To be safe, simply remove a noodle from the water and taste. You want it to be tender yet toothsome (AKA al dente.)",

  description: "Pasta with champignons",
  title: "Helpful advice!",
  adviceText: "Turning off the heat is not enough to stop pasta from cooking. The hot water (even if it's not boiling) will continue to cook it until it turns to mush. The best practice? Strain your pasta as soon as it's done and never let it hang out in hot water off the heat.",

  description: "Grilled shrimp salad",
  title: "Helpful advice!",
  adviceText: "If your shrimp are on the small side, cook them on skewers—or use a grill basket or cast-iron pan—to ensure they don't fall through the grill. The use of skewers also makes flipping grilled shrimp faster and easier. If using wooden skewers, presoak them in water to prevent them from cooking along with the shrimp.",

  bgImage: "/advice02-recipe-07.jpg",
  description: "Grilled shrimp salad",
  title: "Helpful advice!",
  adviceText: "Shrimp should be grilled with the lid open, as closing the lid will increase the temperature inside the grill and could cause the shrimp to overcook. Since the shrimp are small, cook fast, and need to be flipped every few minutes, it's best to keep the lid open on the grill",

  description: "Chocolate custard cream",
  title: "Helpful advice!",
  adviceText: "The mixture's final temperature should be between 80 and 88°F (27°C and 31°C) so that the whipped cream doesn't break down, and the cocoa butter in the chocolate doesn't crystallize too quickly. Use this mousse in assembled desserts or serve it in glasses.",

  description: "Guacamole and Tuna Toast",
  title: "Helpful advice!",

  title: "Helpful advice!",
  adviceText: "Guacamole is all about combining a few simple flavors to make something exceptional—buttery avocado, astringent garlic and onion, acidic lime juice, herbaceous cilantro and spicy peppers. Even if you don't like spicy food, you should still add a pinch of cayenne or minced peppers to bring out the other flavors.",

  description: "Guacamole and Tuna Toast",
  title: "Helpful advice!",
